  <h1>Join Metacaugs Today></h1>

  <h2>Who are we </h2>

  <p> Metacaugs is a group studying the impact of the accelerating technological change on society. The founding members, hailing from various countries and continents, participated in small-scale, intensive online courses facilitated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Rheingold">Howard Rheingold</a>,
    where they practised peer-to-peer learning while studying about collaboration and mind-amplifying tools. </p>

  <p> The backgrounds of the members differ: education, journalism, software development, theology, philosophy, economics... but all are convinced society is confronted with disruptive challenges and opportunities. They are also ambitious: they not only want
    to study but also to contribute to solutions which change the live of potentially millions of people for the better. </p>

  <h2>What do we do</h2>

  <p> We have a weekly videoconference. During that conference we discuss a chapter of a book we deem particularly interesting such as <a href="http://www.thomaslfriedman.com/thank-you-for-being-late/>Thank You for Being Late</a> by Thomas Friedman or <a href="
      https://whiplashbook.com/
      ">Whiplash</a>. </p>
    
    <p>We then discuss specific projects, which are presented by group members or guests. Concrete cases: development of a tool enhancing decision-making and judging, a tool for mindmapping, courses. We use a specific peer-to-peer methodology as described in the <a href="http://peeragogy.github.io/>Peeragogy Handbook</a> and the <a href="http://peeragogy.github.io/action.html">Peeragogy Accelerator document</a>. </p>

  <h2>What can you do</h2>

  <p>You can come and have a look - lurk as much as you want. Or you can join the reading of the current book and participate in the weekly videoconference. You can also present a project you'd like to discuss with the group. You are welcome and joining
    is free. We engage in peer-to-peer learning, we are all co-learners and so are you. </p>
