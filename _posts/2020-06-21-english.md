## [外国人如何背单词](https://www.365yg.com/a6626661723069760003#mid=1617072596129795)

10 ways to memorize English words：memorization methods，what ever you learn，speak it out
- number one，learn phrases instead of words，for example，make an appointment，sign a contract，cancel a meeting
- number two，repeat the word 7 to 10 times when you learn，make sure you use it in conversation with your friends or talk to yourself，then use the word one hour later，then one day/week/month later. If you can do this, you should be able to memorize/remember it
- number three, use post-it note. What are post-it notes you say ? Post sticky note all over your house, bathroom, kitchen, bedroom， where ever you can， It is important to create an environment to learn new words。you can even use different colors to organize，verbs，nouns，adjectives， whatever you like。Fool，what does it mean?
- number 4，keep a vocabulary dairy. this is how I learn Chinese, carry a dairy with you in your purse钱包wallet，your backpack，or whatever you want。when you see the new word，write it down，when you have some free time，you can review it on the bus，subway，whatever
- number 5，draw a picture，are you an artist？draw a picture in your dairy help you to remember the new words
- number 6，make word associations，for example，tasty means good to eat or delicious， so what words associated with the word tasty？maybe for you is hotpot or barbecue烧烤，or for Americans maybe it's French fries or ice cream，here is an example：
  - medicine，coffee，tea：bitter；
  - cake，icecream，cookie：sweet
- number 7，write 3 sentences using the word in context上下文。speak the sentences out loud to practice your English and use the new words，you can use the websites，such as 海词 ，to see the word in the context
- number 8，limit how many words you study each day，3-5 is OK，but 10 should be your maximum。think about it，10 words a day is 3650 in one year，that's a lot，not many people can do it，but if you can do it，then I say GO FOR IT！加油
- number 9，learn related words，for example，care，careful，care free，take care，for this，we use what‘s called thesaurus词库，there are many good and free thesaurus APPs for Androids/iOS
- the last one，the thing that helped me most，flashcard单词卡，you can write them and review them when you have free time or you can download an APP，such as flashcards by dictionary.com ，there is a lot of free APP，just go to your APP store，and type in flashcards，or try this methods。review your flashcards once a day，put the word you get correct into one pile（一堆），keep the words you got wrong to try again tomorrow。Do this each day until you have 4 piles，after you got correct 4 times，it can be removed from all the piles

### 996

[996.ICU](https://996.icu/#/en_US)

What is "996"?
- A "996" work schedule refers to an unofficial work schedule (9 am - 9 pm, 6 days a week) that has been gaining more popularity. Serving a company that encourages the "996" work schedule usually means work for at least 60 hours a week.

Labor Law of the People’s Republic of China
- Labor Law of the People’s Republic of China Article 41 says:
  - The employer can prolong\[prəˈlɑːŋ]延长 work hours due to needs of production or businesses after consultation[,kɑnsl'teʃən]咨询/磋商 with its trade union工会 and laborers. The work hours to be prolonged, in general, shall be no longer than one hour a day, or no more than three hours a day if such prolonging is called for due to special reasons and under the condition that the physical health of laborers is guaranteed. The work time to be prolonged shall not exceed, however, 36 hours a month.

Gaining more popularity and publicity\[pʌb'lɪsəti]宣传、公开、注意
- In early 2019, a Chinese E-commerce company called Youzan announced the adoption of the "996" work schedule in the future, at the company's Chinese New Year Party. The CEO of Youzan responded: "This would definitely be a good decision when we look back in a few years time.".
- In Mid-March 2019, it was reported that Jingdong started adopting "996" or "995" work schedule in some of the business units. Jingdong PR posted on their maimai(脉脉, a Chinese real-name business social network platform) account: "(Our culture is) to devote ourselves with all our hearts (to achieve the business objectives)".
- Although it is gaining more publicity recently, this work scheudle is a commonly known "secret" practiced in a lot of companies in China.

Compensation \[,kɑmpɛn'seʃən]补偿、赔偿 and benefits
- According to the Labor Law, employees who follow the "996" work schedule deserve to be paid 2.275 times of their base salary. Unfortunately, people who work under "996" rarely get paid that much.

Where does the name of the repo 996.ICU come from?
- If you consistently\[kən'sɪstəntli]一贯的、一致的 follow the "996" work schedule, you run the risk of getting yourself into Intensive Care Unit.
Developers' lives matter.

Repo for counting stars and contributing. Press F to pay respect to glorious光荣的 developers.
Suggestions and PRs are welcome!
Join discussion at #20.

Contribution
- Any merged modification to all files will be rendered as github flavored markdown and published on the site regularly.
- Feel free to adjust the format, add some content or fix grammatical errors.

Expand influence
- I18n support is ongoing.
- If you would like to contribute, you can add translations or just write something down in other languages in separate files.
- The key is to make ourselves heard and raise public awareness of working hours violations违反违规 in the workplace of software developers.

【2019-04-25】
Work-life balance is not one size fits all一刀切. It looks different for everyone因人而异. It also changes over time.
- If a 4-hour workday is best for you, cool.
- If a 10-hour workday is your jam, awesome.
- If next week you need a day off, great.
Do what works best for you.

### 年会

[年关将至，"年会“可不要说成“year meeting"](https://www.toutiao.com/i6782352501594128899/)
year meeting?
annual meeting？ # 每年的任何时间，可能是年初，年中或是年末
年末：end of year， end-of-year, year-end
- throw a party: 举行派对（最常见）
- hold a party: 举行派对
- host a party: 主持派对

正确说法：end of year party/ end-of-year party/ year-end party

Would you like to join our end of year party? 您愿意参加我们公司的年会吗？
有的公司年会规模很大，像一个盛会一样。 这种叫：
Gala:ˈ[ɡalə] 庆典， 盛会

- Spring Festival Gala： 春晚
- end of year/end-of-year/year-end bonus:年终奖
- end of year/end-of-year school activity/ year-end school activity:年终学校活动
- end of show music/end-of-show music:节目尾曲

示例
- "Do you want to drink something " 不是 “你想喝什么饮料”
- "to drink something"理解为“喝点什么”，但老外会把它认为是 “喝点什么酒”。因为在英文里， "drink"除了“饮用”还指“含酒精的饮料”
- "Would you like something to drink?" 划重点，这里"something to drink"表达的是“喝什么饮料”
- "Do you want to drink something? Whiskey or tequila?"   “想喝点什么酒吗？威士忌还是龙舌兰？”
- "Take a seat while I get you something to drink."  “请坐，我去给你拿点喝的。”

### 6个迹象表明你的工作环境“有毒”

【2021-12-30】[6个迹象表明你的工作环境“有毒”](https://m.haiwainet.cn/ttc/3541083/2021/1229/content_32306276_1.html) 6 signs you have a toxic workplace

1. There’s an abject lack of communication 缺乏沟通
  - Improper communication means that people are often scattered or confused about expectations from leadership. Projects may seem complicated, stressful and difficult to execute either because there aren't enough hands on deck, or there are too many people who want to take the reins.
  - 沟通不善意味着员工往往会是一盘散沙，或者弄不清领导想要什么。项目可能会显得复杂、压力重重，也会难以执行，或者是因为人手不够，或是因为人人都想发号施令。
2. Gossip culture is prevalent 八卦文化盛行
  - In addition to spreading false info, gossip can lead to cliques forming, which consequently means there’s an exclusionist culture in place. People can lose their jobs, arguments arise more quickly and the office vibe becomes more Mean Girls. Not good.
  - 除了散播假消息，八卦还会导致拉帮结派，在公司内部形成排外文化。人们可能会因此而丢掉工作，同事间争吵频发，办公室氛围会变得像电影《贱女孩》里演的那样。不是什么好事。
3. There’s no room for growth 没有成长空间
  - We all do our best work when we know it counts for something. But if you’re working for a company that’s stuck in their decades-old routine and is resistant to new ideas, you can easily feel stifled. If you can’t pitch new ideas or improve upon your skillset, that may be one sign. It’s also good to take stock of the people you work with and evaluate whether or not they’ve grown. If you notice that your cubicle mate has been in an assistant position for three years, yet she knows the business in and out, you may just be working for a company that doesn’t support progression.
  - 当我们知道努力有意义的时候，我们都会做到最好。但如果你就职的公司墨守成规，拒绝新理念，就很容易让你产生窒息的感觉。如果你不能提出新想法或提升自己的技能，这也许就是个“中毒”迹象。你也可以观察你的同事，评估他们是否得到了成长。如果你注意到你的某个同事已经在助理岗位待了三年，而她早就对业务了如指掌，你所在的公司可能根本不支持员工晋升。
4. You can’t create a work-life balance 你无法达到工作和生活的平衡
  - If your boss demands that your job come before your boyfriend’s birthday or Dad’s visit from Chicago a la Devil Wears Prada, then yes, you’re in a toxic workplace. Of course, it’s important to give your all from nine to five (or whatever your prescribed work hours). But if you’re constantly receiving emails, text messages or phone calls during your days off, and can’t make plans with your loved ones because you may have to hop in a meeting, it’s time to reconsider.
  - 如果你的老板像《穿普拉达的女王》里演的那样，要求你把工作放在第一位，哪怕是男友生日或父亲从外地来看你也不例外，那么你的工作环境确实有毒。当然，上班时间全力以赴很重要，但是如果你在下班之后还不断地收到电子邮件、短信或接到电话，或因为要随时准备开会而无法和爱人约会，那么你是时候该重新考虑一下了。
5. Employees are unmotivated 员工没有动力
  - If managers are not communicating, not giving their employees room to grow and not compensating them appropriately for their hard work, odds are, morale is low. That can mean none of the old employees are willing to help new hires assimilate, everyone only interacts with members on their team and no one is willing to step up and do double duty during peak seasons. This may happen not just because there’s no incentive to go above and beyond your daily duties, but also because everyone is already juggling so much, there’s literally no room to add anything else to their plates.
  - 如果主管不沟通、不给员工成长空间，对他们的辛苦劳动也没有给予足够的回报，那么士气低落是很正常的。这可能意味着老员工不愿帮助新员工融入集体，每个人都只和自己团队里的人交流，没有人愿意在旺季主动承担双重任务。这不仅是因为晋升无望、多干没回报，也可能因为每个人手头的活儿已经满额，再多的话根本做不了。
6. There’s high turnover 人员流动率很高
  - One tell-tale sign that something is wrong within the workplace is when employees come and go at breakneck speed. With so many people (especially millennials) prioritizing their wellness and mental health, no one is going to want to stay in a place that disrupts that. So, if you find that your co-workers are dropping like flies, it’s wise to analyze the culture.
  - 人员流动率很高是工作环境有毒的一个警示。现如今人们（尤其是千禧一代）都很看重自己的身心健康，没有人愿意待在一个摧残身心的地方工作。所以，如果你发现同事们纷纷离职，你应该审视一下这里的工作文化是否有问题。

How to Cope with a Toxic Work Environment

如何应对有毒的工作环境

Unhappy as you may be at your job, leaving is not always an option. So, if you find yourself having to put up with toxic work culture, there are a few things you can try to make your experience better.

尽管你可能干得不开心，但是你也无法说走就走。所以，如果你发现自己不得不忍受有毒的工作文化，你可以通过下面的做法来让自己感觉好一点。

For one, you can take a stab at building a circle of trusted co-workers, people you know will help you reach your goals and won’t bring any unnecessary drama your way. You can also create boundaries—whether that’s letting people know you’re not into the gossip or making it clear that your personal time is not for work. Above everything else, make sure that you keep your professionalism and remain kind to people, hard as it may be. After all, it’s easy to get sucked into petty gossip or low morale, but staying focused on your long-term goals, upkeeping your work ethic and treating people well will never go out of style. (Just don’t be afraid to simultaneously update that resume.)

首先，你可以和信任的同事建立社交圈，他们能帮助你达到你的目标，又不会给你找事儿。其次，划清界限，包括和八卦的人划清界限，或者划清上班和下班时间的界限。最后也是最重要的一点是，尽管很艰难，但一定要保持专业性，始终待人友善。陷入八卦和消沉的泥沼很容易，但是你要知道，朝着长期目标努力、保持职业道德和善待他人永远不会错。（与此同时要更新你的简历，迈出勇敢的一步。）
